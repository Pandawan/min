# min

A small project to teach myself creating interpreted programming languages.

I am following the [Crafting Interpreters book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom.

## TODO (after)

- Add advanced operators like modulo, bitwise, power, etc.
- Change `print` from a keyword to a function
- Add `foreach` loops (for in, for of, etc.)
- Use `:` for inheritance, not `<`
- Add a `Min.version` as part of the Min library/object (kind of meta object)
